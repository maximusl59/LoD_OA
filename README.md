NOTE: if you would like to run the colab with the Streamlit frontend, you must replace the **colab url** in frontend.py with the **public url** that colab provides at the bottom of the notebook (after running). 
- otherwise, please comment out block 9 in the notebook and uncomment block 10 to use the notebook without frontend

Please email me with any other questions as the arise
